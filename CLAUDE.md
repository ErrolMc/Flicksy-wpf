# Working in this repo

## Read this first

[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) is the structural map of the current build. **Read it before exploring the codebase.** Use its tables and links to jump straight to the file the change touches — do not glob/grep the tree to rediscover structure that's already documented.

The doc is written to be self-sufficient: it names every project, every namespace folder, every drawing tool, every undo command, and the file behind each. If the answer to "where does X live?" is in there, do not search.

## Keeping ARCHITECTURE.md current

Whenever you make a change that alters the structural picture, update ARCHITECTURE.md in the **same change**. Structural means: anything a future session would need the map to discover.

Update when you:
- Add / remove / rename a project, folder, namespace, or top-level concept.
- Add / remove / rename a `DrawingItem` subclass, `IDrawingTool`, `IUndoableCommand`, ViewModel, UserControl, or major service (`IVideoPlayer`, `FfmpegLocator`, etc).
- Change the inter-process contract (Agent ↔ Snipper ↔ Editor args, temp-file conventions, hotkey).
- Change a load-bearing convention (e.g. how undo commands snapshot state, how tools register, how text editing is hosted).
- Change the save flow, capture pipeline, or media-playback model.
- Add a new NuGet dependency or external-binary requirement.

Do NOT update for:
- Refactors that don't change names or relationships (rename a private field, extract a private method).
- Bug fixes that don't change the public shape.
- Cosmetic XAML changes.
- One-line behavior tweaks (timing constants, default colors, etc).

## Style of edits to ARCHITECTURE.md

The doc is optimized for **input-token efficiency** — future sessions load it into context every time. Keep it that way.

Rules:
1. **Use tables and bullet lists, not prose.** A row in a table is cheaper to load and easier to scan than a paragraph.
2. **Link to files; don't duplicate their content.** Use `[name](path/to/file.cs)` and `[name](path:line)`. Future Claude will Read the file when it needs the body — don't paste it into the doc.
3. **One sentence per fact.** If a fact needs two sentences, the second is usually load-bearing nuance — keep it. If it's a restatement, cut it.
4. **No screenshots, no diagrams in ASCII art** unless they're materially clearer than text. The one tree diagram in §4.1 is the budget.
5. **No history.** Don't write "previously this was X, now it's Y." The doc describes the current build only. Git history is the changelog.
6. **No emojis.**
7. **Headings stay stable.** Sections are referenced by future edits. If you add a new section, add it; don't reorder existing ones unless the structure genuinely changed.
8. **Section 7 ("Where to look for common changes")** is a router. When you add a meaningfully new feature area, add a row.
9. **Section 6 ("Conventions")** is for invariants that future sessions would otherwise re-derive. Add a bullet if you introduce a new convention; remove one if it's no longer true.

If an edit would push the doc significantly longer, consider whether the new material is structural (keep, terse) or detail that belongs in the source file's own comment / a follow-up doc.

## Domain glossary

[CONTEXT.md](docs/CONTEXT.md) is the project's domain glossary — the canonical names for the concepts this codebase deals with (snip editor vs. video editor, `Project`/`Track`/`Clip` shape, etc.) and which alternative terms to avoid. Read it before any design conversation. Update it inline (during the conversation, not after) whenever a term is sharpened or a new one emerges. It is a glossary only — no implementation details, no decisions, no plans.

Architectural decisions live in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) following the standard ADR format. Add a new one only when a decision is hard to reverse, surprising without context, and the result of a real trade-off.

## What goes in this CLAUDE.md vs ARCHITECTURE.md vs CONTEXT.md

- **CLAUDE.md** = instructions to the model (this file). Keep it short.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** = the map of the code. Update when the map changes.
- **CONTEXT.md** = the glossary. Update when terms change.

Don't move build/run instructions, project descriptions, or file pointers into CLAUDE.md — they belong in ARCHITECTURE.md so they aren't loaded into every session's context unconditionally.
