# Video editor — plan index

The video editor implementation is tracked on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ErrolMc/Flicksy/issues) as 22 numbered issues. This file is a navigable overview by phase number — the issues themselves are the source of truth.

Issues labeled [`needs-design`](https://github.com/ErrolMc/Flicksy/labels/needs-design) have `What's known` and `Open questions` sections in the body and need a grilling session before implementation. Issues without that label are fully scoped and ready to pick up.
